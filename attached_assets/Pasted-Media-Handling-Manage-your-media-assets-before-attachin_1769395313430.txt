Media Handling
Manage your media assets before attaching them to posts. Publer’s API supports direct uploads and URL imports, returning media IDs you can reference when creating or updating posts.

Overview
Before including media in your social media posts, you must first upload those files to Publer's servers. The API provides two methods for uploading media:

Direct file upload

Upload from URL

Once uploaded, you'll receive a media ID that can be referenced in your post requests.

Direct File Upload
Use this method when you have local media files that you want to upload directly.

Limitation
Maximum file size for direct uploads: 200MB per file.

Requests exceeding 200MB will be rejected (typically with HTTP 413 Payload Too Large). For larger files, use the Upload from URL method.

Request Format
This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data request with the file included in the file field.

Using Media in Posts
Once you've uploaded media and have the media ID, you can reference it in your post requests:


Copy
{
  "bulk": {
    "state": "scheduled",
    "posts": [
      {
        "networks": {
          "default": {
            "type": "photo",
            "text": "Check out our latest product!",
            "media": [
              {
                "id": "6813892b5ec8b1e65235ae9e",
                "type": "image",
                "alt_text": "Product on white background"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "accounts": [
          {
            "id": "66db83154e299efa19a2d8eb",
            "scheduled_at": "2025-05-15T14:30:00Z"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Network Validation
The validity object in the media upload response indicates which networks and post types can use the uploaded media. This helps prevent errors when attempting to use incompatible media in your posts.

For example, if validity.instagram.reel is false, the uploaded media cannot be used for Instagram Reels.

Best Practices
Image Optimization
Resolution: Use appropriate image resolutions for each platform

Aspect ratio: Follow recommended aspect ratios to avoid cropping

File size: Optimize images for web to reduce file size

Alt text: Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility

Video Optimization
Format: Use MP4 with H.264 encoding for maximum compatibility

Dimensions: Use 1080p (1920x1080) for standard videos

Aspect ratio: 16:9 for horizontal, 9:16 for vertical/stories/reels

Duration: Keep videos under platform limits

Thumbnails: Consider uploading custom thumbnails for videos

General Tips
Pre-check compatibility: Review the validity object before using media

Error handling: Implement robust error handling for upload failures

Caching: Cache media IDs to avoid unnecessary re-uploads
