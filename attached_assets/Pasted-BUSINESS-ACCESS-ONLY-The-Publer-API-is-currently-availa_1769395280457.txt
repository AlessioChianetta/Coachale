BUSINESS ACCESS ONLY: The Publer API is currently available exclusively to Publer Business users.

This guide walks you through the core steps to integrate with Publer’s API in minutes. By the end, you’ll have published your first scheduled post.

Prerequisites
A Business Publer account

Basic familiarity with HTTP/JSON APIs

A command-line tool (curl) or API client (Postman, Insomnia)

Step 1: Generate an API Key
Sign in to Publer and verify you have Business plan access.

Go to Settings → Access & Login → API Keys.

Click Create API Key.

Enter a descriptive name, then select scopes:

workspaces

accounts

posts

Click Create.

Copy and store the key securely—this value will not be shown again.

Step 2: List Workspaces
Before making other requests, let's retrieve your workspaces. The workspace ID is required in the header for most API operations:


Copy
curl -X GET "https://app.publer.com/api/v1/workspaces" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer-API YOUR_API_KEY"
Sample Response

Copy
[
    {
      "id": "5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1",
      "name": "My Primary Workspace",
      "role": "owner",
      "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/workspaces/thumb_mini_workspace_123.png"
    },
    {
      "id": "60a2e45f9b3c8d002a4b7c32",
      "name": "Client Workspace",
      "role": "admin",
      "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/workspaces/thumb_mini_workspace_456.png"
    }
]
Now you can use a workspace ID in your subsequent requests by including it in the header:


Copy
Publer-Workspace-Id: 5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1
Step 3: List Social Accounts
Next, let's retrieve the social media accounts in your workspace. You'll need the account IDs to specify where to publish your posts:


Copy
curl -X GET "https://app.publer.com/api/v1/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer-API YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Publer-Workspace-ID: 5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1"
Expected Response

Copy
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "id": "63c675b54e299e9cf2b667ea",
      "name": "My Facebook Page",
      "provider": "facebook",
      "type": "page",
      "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/accounts/thumb_mini_facebook_page.jpg",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "id": "63c675d74e299e9cf2b667eb",
      "name": "Company LinkedIn Page",
      "provider": "linkedin",
      "type": "page",
      "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/accounts/thumb_mini_linkedin_page.jpg",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "id": "63c675e94e299e9cf2b667ec",
      "name": "Brand Twitter",
      "provider": "twitter",
      "type": "profile",
      "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/accounts/thumb_mini_twitter.jpg",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
Make note of the account IDs as you'll need them to specify where to publish your content in the next step.

Step 4: Create a Scheduled Post
Make your first scheduled post with one API call:


Copy
curl -X POST "https://app.publer.com/api/v1/posts/schedule" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer-API YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Publer-Workspace-Id: 5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bulk": {
      "state": "scheduled",
      "posts": [
        {
          "networks": {
            // You need to provide the network provider as the key, e.g., facebook, twitter
            "facebook": {
              "type": "status", // Type of the post
              "text": "Status Update Post" // Text of the post
            }
          },
          "accounts": [
            {
              "id": "63c675b54e299e9cf2b667ea", // Id of the selected account
              "scheduled_at": "2025-09-06T14:16+02:00" // Scheduled time
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
Sample Response
The API returns a job ID that you can use to check the status of your request:


Copy
{
  "job_id": "68176fa0f0eb419444bee686"
}
Step 5: Poll Job Status
Posts are created asynchronously. Use the returned job_id to check progress:


Copy
curl -X GET "https://app.publer.com/api/v1/job_status/68176fa0f0eb419444bee686" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer-API YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Publer-Workspace-Id: 5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1"
Successful Job Response

Copy
{
  "status": "complete",
  "payload": {
    "failures": {}
  },
  "plan": {
    // other account-specific data
  }
}
Failed Job Response
If there's an error with your request, the response will include details about what went wrong:


Copy
{
  "status": "complete",
  "payload": {
    "failures":[
        {
          "account_id": "63c675b54e299e9cf2b667ea",
          "account_name": "Test Page",
          "provider": "facebook",
          "message": "There's another post at this time. A one minute gap is required between posts"
        }
    ]
  },
  "plan": {
    // other account-specific data
  }
}
Step 6: Verify Scheduled Posts
List your scheduled posts to confirm creation:


Copy
curl -X GET "https://app.publer.com/api/v1/posts?state=scheduled" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer-API YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Publer-Workspace-ID: 5f8d7a62c9e77e001f36e3a1"
Sample Response

Copy
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "68176f0e8bee9dc9b0ce3427",
      "text": "Status Update Post for 2025-05-07!",
      "url": null,
      "title": null,
      "state": "scheduled",
      "type": "status",
      "account_id": "63c675b54e299e9cf2b667ea",
      "user": {
        "id": "5b1ec026db27977424e8599e",
        "name": "Business User",
        "picture": "https://publer.io/uploads/photos/thumb_mini_magick20250123-28707-otuw0w.png"
      },
      "scheduled_at": "2025-05-08T14:30:00.000+02:00",
      "post_link": null
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
Understanding the Workflow
Generate an API key

List workspaces → pick a workspace ID

List accounts → pick account IDs

Submit a post creation request

Poll job status until completed

Fetch posts to verify

This async pattern scales across multiple workspaces, accounts, and post types.
