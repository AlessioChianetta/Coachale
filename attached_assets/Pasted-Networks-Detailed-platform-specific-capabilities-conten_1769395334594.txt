Best Practices
Cross-Platform Posting

Provide network-specific overrides under networks for optimal formatting.

Adjust media dimensions to each platform’s specs.

Tailor text length to char limits.

Platform Selection

Choose networks based on audience and content type.

Leverage visual platforms (Instagram, Pinterest) for images/video-heavy campaigns.

Use LinkedIn for professional announcements; Facebook/Instagram for broad reach.

Error Prevention

Pre-validate media compatibility via upload responses’ validity flags.

Poll job status to catch and handle errors early.
