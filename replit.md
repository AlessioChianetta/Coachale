# User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
User requested "obsessive-compulsive" attention to detail when verifying what works and what doesn't.
User prefers direct SQL for any database modifications (not ORM migrations).

# System Architecture
The application features a modern UI/UX built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and `shadcn/ui`, prioritizing accessibility and responsiveness. The backend uses Express.js, TypeScript, JWT, bcrypt, and PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), implementing robust role-based access control (consultant, client, super_admin) and a multi-profile system. The UI/UX employs a Revolut-style design system with reusable CSS utilities and shared components, ensuring responsive and accessible UI with proper dark mode support using CSS variables.

**Key Features and Design Patterns:**

*   **AI Integration:** Provides personalized financial insights, multi-tenant semantic search, consultation summarization, and AI-powered integrations (WhatsApp Business, Instagram, X DMs). Includes configurable AI sales agents, automated follow-up and client check-ins, and tools for generating courses and exercises. A ChatGPT-style AI Assistant offers dynamic model selection, reasoning visualization, conversation memory, and a hybrid AI context system with token optimization and RAG. A Consultation Function Calling System with an LLM Intent Classifier ensures intelligent tool usage and guardrails. Knowledge Base enhancement allows custom instructions in AI system prompts.
*   **Subscription & Licensing:** A multi-tier subscription system manages AI agent access, consultant licenses, revenue sharing, and AI credits with Stripe integration.
*   **Content & Marketing Studio:** Features AI tools for content idea generation, social media copy, a 6-step campaign builder, AI image generation, and a Lead Nurturing 365 System with automated AI-generated email sequences. A Content Autopilot System automates content scheduling.
    *   **Millie Email Writer (Email Hub):** Branded as "Millie", the Email Hub (`/consultant/email-hub`) is an intelligent email management system with IMAP/SMTP, unified inboxes, and AI-powered response generation. Key features:
        *   **No-Reply Filter**: `shouldSkipAutoResponse()` detects and ignores test SMTP, bounce, newsletter, auto-reply, OOO emails before AI processing (processingStatus = 'ignored').
        *   **CRM Context Enrichment**: `buildContactContext()` searches lead_scraper_results, proactive_leads, and users to identify the sender and inject full CRM context into AI prompts.
        *   **Profilo Commerciale (Per-Account Sales Context)**: Each email account has its own `sales_context` jsonb column (9 fields: servicesOffered, targetAudience, valueProposition, pricingInfo, competitiveAdvantages, idealClientProfile, salesApproach, caseStudies, additionalContext). Configured in the AI Settings dialog (`EmailAISettings.tsx`). Injected directly into Millie's prompt with `[MILLIE-SALES]` logging. Completely independent from Hunter's `lead_scraper_sales_context`.
        *   **Client FileSearch Integration**: When the sender is a registered client, Millie searches their private FileSearch documents via `fileSearchService.getStoreNamesForGeneration()`. Logged with `[MILLIE-FILESEARCH]` prefix. Non-clients are skipped.
        *   **Cross-Channel Context**: `buildCrossChannelContext()` retrieves WhatsApp messages (8 msgs with contact name resolved via proactive_leads/users JOIN, message_type), voice call transcripts (3 calls with direction detection via caller_id/called_number), bidirectional email thread (15 emails with snippets), AI scheduled tasks for the contact (5 recent), and Hunter outreach actions (5 recent). Max context: 3000 chars. Injected into AI prompts.
        *   **Email Type Classification**: Deterministic `determineEmailType()` classifies emails as hunter_reply, system_notification, client_inquiry, lead_inquiry, or unknown. Stored in `hub_emails.email_type` column. Frontend shows color-coded badges and filter dropdown.
        *   **Adaptive Response Engine**: `detectResponseIntent()` identifies 7 intent types (info request, call accept, not interested, callback later, client problem, enthusiastic, generic) and applies scenario-specific response strategies.
        *   **Smart Non-Response Rules**: `detectSmartSkip()` avoids responding to acknowledgment-only emails, unsubscribe requests, and own outbound messages.
        *   **Millie Auto-Actions**: `executeMillieActions()` post-processes AI drafts to update lead status (interested/lost), create reminder tasks, cancel follow-ups, and escalate uncertain emails.
        *   **Outreach Pipeline**: A dedicated tab showing the complete Hunter email outreach flow — emails sent, follow-ups scheduled, responses received — with stats and quick actions. Backend endpoint: `GET /api/email-hub/outreach-pipeline`.
        *   **Sent Email Tracking**: Compose and Reply endpoints save outbound emails to `hub_emails` with `folder: "sent"`, `direction: "outbound"`, and `receivedAt` set to current time. Inbox ordering uses `COALESCE(received_at, sent_at, created_at)` for robustness. List API computes `toEmail` from `toRecipients[0]`. Frontend shows recipient (not sender) for outbound emails with "A:" prefix.
        *   **Millie Branding**: The entire UI is branded as "Millie Email Writer" with avatar, personalized labels, and context visibility panels.
        *   **Ticket Email Notifications**: When Millie creates a ticket (low confidence, high urgency, negative sentiment, escalation keyword, no KB answer), an HTML email notification is sent to the consultant via the account's SMTP. Built in `sendTicketEmailNotification()` in `ticket-webhook-service.ts`. All dynamic content is HTML-escaped for security.
    *   **Hunter Email Templates Library**: `server/ai/email-templates-library.ts` — 10 structured persuasive email templates (first contact, follow-up, break-up, trigger event, case study, pain point, free value, referral, compliment, re-engagement) with `selectTemplateForScenario()` selection logic and `GOLDEN_RULES` copywriting guidelines. Integrated into `hunter-direct-executor.ts` for AI-guided email generation.
    *   **Automatic Email Follow-up System**: `checkEmailFollowUps()` in `ai-task-scheduler.ts` — cron job (09:00, 14:00, 18:00) checks outbound Hunter emails for replies. Configurable from the Lead Scraper page (Configurazione Hunter → Follow-up tab → "Follow-up Email Automatici" section). Config stored in `outreach_config.emailFollowUp` (jsonb on `ai_autonomy_settings`): `followUp1Days` (default 3), `followUp2Days` (default 7), `maxFollowUps` (default 2), `followUp1TemplateId`/`followUp2TemplateId` (select from 10 templates), `autoApprove` (default false — tasks go to waiting_approval), `enabled` toggle. Anti-duplication via result_data matching. Manual trigger: `POST /api/ai-autonomy/hunter/check-followups` (also reads config from DB). Interface: `EmailFollowUpConfig` in `shared/schema.ts`.
*   **Data Analysis:** A "compute-first" system processes structured data, separating deterministic calculation (SQL) from AI interpretation. Includes efficient Excel parsing, dynamic tables with Row Level Security (RLS), Server-Sent Events (SSE), and an enterprise-grade Semantic Layer. A Multi-CSV Join System supports uploading multiple CSV files with automatic relationship detection.
*   **Consultant Workflow:** A 4-phase, 27-step Consultant Setup Wizard guides configuration, alongside configurable monthly consultation limits. An integrated **Accademia di Formazione** LMS at `/consultant/academy` provides dynamically managed lessons organized in modules with progress tracking. A **Client Library** (`/client/library`) uses an Academy-style layout for document and exercise presentation.
*   **Communication & Automation:**
    *   **Voice Telephony (Alessia AI Phone):** Integrates FreeSWITCH with Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio for real-time voice AI, automatic caller recognition, call management, and recording. Includes a Direction-Based Voice Template System and AI Task Scheduling for automated calls.
    *   **AI Autonomous Employee (Multi-Role):** A Decision Engine uses Gemini to analyze client context and generate multi-step execution plans with granular real-time activity logging. Guardrails enforce working hours and channel restrictions. Eight specialized AI agents exist (Alessia, Millie, Echo, Nova, Stella, Marco, Hunter, Personalizza — Iris was removed as redundant with Millie), supporting per-role client filtering, dual reasoning modes, post-generation anti-duplication of tasks, configurable AI model selection (Gemini 3 Flash / 3.1 Pro) with thinking levels, and per-role temperature control. The Dipendenti AI card list auto-sorts enabled employees above disabled ones.
    *   **Hunter Outreach System (Individual Task Architecture):** Autonomous lead prospecting pipeline using SerpApi for Google Maps/Search and Firecrawl for enrichment. Hunter is the "commercial brain" — finds leads, qualifies them, decides channel/timing, then creates **individual AI-personalized tasks per lead** in the correct calendars. "Analizza CRM" generates per-lead content via `generateOutreachContent()` (voice scripts, WA messages, emails) and schedules via `scheduleIndividualOutreach()` — voice calls go into `scheduled_voice_calls` (Voice Calendar), WA messages into `ai_scheduled_tasks` with `task_type='single_whatsapp'` and `preferred_channel='whatsapp'` (WA Calendar, sent directly via Twilio without Decision Engine), emails via SMTP+`hub_emails` (Email Hub). `max_leads_per_batch` is configurable from frontend (slider, default 15). Four modes: **Diretto** (every 30 min finds 1 lead, AI decides channel/message, executes immediately — voice→`scheduled_voice_calls`, WA→`ai_scheduled_tasks`, email→nodemailer — creates `proactive_leads` entry with `source='hunter'`; logged in `hunter_actions` table), Full Autonomo (tasks auto-scheduled), Piano Interattivo (AI plan → chat → approve), Solo Approvazione (tasks created as `waiting_approval`). Features: unified outreach queue with channel/status filters, collapsible activity timeline, configurable multi-step follow-up sequences, post-call transcript AI classification with automatic next actions, KPI conversion metrics. Config includes `email_account_id`, `whatsapp_config_id`, `voice_template_id` for channel routing. Direct mode executor: `server/ai/hunter-direct-executor.ts`. API: `GET /api/ai-autonomy/hunter/actions`, `POST /api/ai-autonomy/hunter/trigger-direct`. Hunter-found leads appear in `/consultant/proactive-leads` with teal "Hunter" badge.
    *   **Auto Proactive Lead Registration (`ensureProactiveLead`):** Utility in `server/utils/ensure-proactive-lead.ts` — any contact reached via any channel (voice call, WhatsApp outbound, scheduled task) is automatically registered in `proactive_leads` if not already present (phone dedup via unique constraint). Integrated at: POST /api/ai-autonomy/tasks (manual task creation), executeSingleWhatsApp (after WA send), handleSuccess (voice call initiated), POST /voice/outbound/trigger (direct call), POST /voice/outbound/schedule (scheduled call). Uses ON CONFLICT upsert to handle race conditions. Status set to 'pending' for scheduled items, 'contacted' for executed ones.
    *   **Assisted Mode (Modalità Assistita):** Allows AI tasks to pause for consultant feedback and context injection.
    *   **Intelligent Document Generation:** Generates dual output (summary and formal document) with dynamic classification and adaptive PDF layouts.
    *   **Voice Supervisors (LLM Architecture):** Real-time transcript analysis for task management and booking.
    *   **Venditori Autonomi (Consultant Sales Agents):** The Sales Agents feature (originally client-only at `/client/sales-agents`) is now accessible to consultants at `/consultant/sales-agents`. Backend endpoints in `sales-agent-config.ts` and `sales-scripts.ts` accept both `client` and `consultant` roles. Frontend `AuthGuard` supports array of roles (`requiredRole={["client", "consultant"]}`). Pages (`client-sales-agents-list.tsx`, `client-sales-agent-config.tsx`, `client-sales-agent-analytics.tsx`, `client-script-manager.tsx`) detect user role via `getAuthUser()` and adapt sidebar role + navigation paths dynamically. Sidebar entry: "Venditori Autonomi" under COMUNICAZIONE. Dipendenti AI page has "Live Consultation" and "Nuovo Venditore AI" buttons. Live-consultation page (`/live-consultation`) also accepts consultant role.
*   **AI Autonomy UI Structure:** The Dipendenti AI page (`/consultant/ai-autonomy`) uses a unified single tab bar with 8 tabs. It features Kanban UX with scroll-snap columns, drag-to-scroll, prominent status badges, and conversational activity logs where AI employees "talk" to the consultant.
*   **Bidirectional Telegram Bot Integration:** Each AI employee can have its own Telegram bot, supporting 1:1 private and group chats with bidirectional message syncing and an "Open Mode" for AI-driven conversational onboarding.
*   **Global Consultation Store (Marco + Alessia):** Aggregates client consultation notes and email journey documents into a single consultant-specific store, optimized for AI access. Alessia also loads the Global Store, recent WhatsApp conversations, and AI-assistant chat history.
*   **Voice Latency Optimization System:** Implements in-memory caching for voice-critical data, scheduled call query deduplication, single `voiceThinkingBudget` application, first-message barge-in protection, deferred prompt injection, and configurable VAD (Voice Activity Detection). Includes smart DB warmup and WS warmup mode. Alessia Enhanced Intelligence System features persistent client memory, client-specific measurable objectives, automatic post-consultation detection, dynamic call scripts, and an AI-powered feedback loop.
*   **Operational Data File Search Optimization:** Reduces AI chat system prompt token count by syncing operational data as `sourceType: "operational_context"`.
*   **Consultant Detailed Profile:** Stores comprehensive consultant information across 8 sections, integrated into the AI's understanding.
*   **System Robustness:** Includes a 4-week calendar, universal PDF support, real-time Google Drive sync, a Dataset Sync API, a Data Sync Observability Dashboard, an Intent Follow-Through System, a Partner Webhook Notification System, and a Database-Based Cron Mutex. An Anti-Zombie Connection System prevents stale Gemini WebSocket connections.
*   **AI Streaming Architecture:** The system handles streaming responses from Google Gemini API and Vertex AI, mapping SDK chunks to `GeminiStreamChunk` objects and yielding typed SSE events for `code_execution`, `code_execution_result`, `generated_file`, `function_call`, and `thinking`.

*   **Skill Store:** A marketplace for importing and creating AI skills, which are markdown instructions injected into the Gemini AI system prompt. Supports file uploads and code execution.
*   **Lead Scraper:** A dual-engine search via SerpAPI (Google Maps and Google Search) with website enrichment via Firecrawl. Features smart caching, CSV export, CRM lead management with status tracking, notes, and deal values. Includes an AI Sales Agent for generating structured sales reports and AI Keyword Suggestions for search queries. A slide-in chat panel provides conversational interaction.
